## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox
- Flex-direction: column;
- Heading 3
- Paragraph element
- Box-shadow property
- padding on White div container


### What I learned
I want to talk a little bit about the images inside div container. Are they necesarry or are they not? I know that by default pictures are inline-block, meaning they allow for other elements to be placed beside it on the same line, but in this case the other elements inside a div, which makes them by default display block, anyways, what is the best way to deal with images in general when it comes to html and css? I guess this always depends on the situation aswell, but I need to get better at understandig the picture element in general and also how to make them look good on the page. Because in this example I only just changed the entire width and height of the image itself. Did not touch the div container it lived inside.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Future topics I need to work further on are the images inside of html and css, getting better at understanding flexbox, and also use semnatic HTML. Those are my main focus areas for the coming projects aswell. Flexbox is such a strong tool, so I feel like I ned to give it some solid attention.
